Every fifteen minutes, someone in the UK is
told they're going blind.

2
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.016
Someone like me needs to be there for them,
from the beginning.

3
00:00:52.016 --> 00:00:58.051
To listen. To care. To answer every question.
To help them face the future, without fear.

4
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:03.110
But today only one in ten people get the chance
to talk to a sight loss advisor like me.

5
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:09.009
That's why I need you.
Together, we can be there for everyone losing

6
00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.118
their sight. From the moment they need us
most.

life without sight.
