<h3>Trustees</h3>

<p>Would you be interested in supporting the work of the society at
	Board level?</p>

<p>The Society is managed by an Executive Committee of between 10
	and 15 Trustees, elected annually by the members of the organisation.
	If you have skills to offer our board we would be glad to hear you and
	could co-opt you on to the Board until the next AGM (normally
	September).</p>
<p>We are particularly interested in hearing from people with a
	business background or business skills. The Executive Committee meets
	in the early evening on the third Monday of every other month at the
	Society&lsquo;s offices in Rougier House. Members will contribute as
	suits their skills and interests in their own time at other times.</p>

<p>By virtue of its constitution the Society tries to have a
	majority of blind or partially sighted people as Trustees, however
	currently we meet this constitutional requirement and so will welcome
	interest from any one visually impaired or otherwise.</p>

<p>For further information about serving as a board member please
	contact Diane Roworth, Chief Officer on 01904 731121 or by email on
	diane.roworth@ybpss.org</p>
