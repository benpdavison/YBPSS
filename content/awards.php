<h4>Mentoring &amp; Befriending</h4>

<p>
	We are delighted that our Home Visiting Service has been re-accredited
	by the Mentoring & Befriending Foundation and our Approved Provider
	Standard has been granted for a further 3 years.<br> Our scheme
	meets the key management and operational requirements of the standard
	and is deemed to deliver a quality service. The assessment confirmed we
	have a clear supervisory structure in place to support the project and
	the preparation process for participants. Volunteers are appropriately
	screened and are then given relevant training and guidance, a careful
	matching procedure is in operation and on-going support is provided
	once the relationships have begun. So, anyone who uses our Visiting
	Service can be assured that it is provided to the highest standards.
