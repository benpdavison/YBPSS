<?php echo '<h3>Fundraising</h3>
<p>Welcome to our fundraising page. We are a small team of
	fundraisers who run various community fundraising events throughout the
	year. We organise stalls, sponsored events, concerts and hold
	collections in stores, at the Railway Station and in the City. All of
	the money raised goes to help us provide our services to the local
	community of York.</p>

<p>In 2014 Dean&lsquo;s Garden Centre made us their Charity of the
	Year and we are absolutely thrilled that Deans Garden Centre have
	raised such a fantastic Â£14257.97 for York Blind and Partially Sighted
	Society. We thank all of the staff, partners and customers for their
	enthusiasm, hard work and generosity â€“it takes an enormous amount of
	consistent effort to raise such a large sum, and we really appreciate
	what they have done. Their efforts will help us to run our Equipment
	and Information Centre in Rougier Street, York a unique service really
	valued by blind and partially sighted people. Dragon boat race</p>

	in touch if you are interested in helping. We always need bright ideas,
	homemade cakes, help with banking â€“ all sorts of skills. No
	experience necessary. If you would like to help, please ring 01904
