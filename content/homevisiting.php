<h3>Home Visiting</h3>
<p>A free service aiming to help visually impaired people maintain
	as much independence as possible. Volunteers visit blind or partially
	sighted people in their own homes to provide practical help, emotional
	support or companionship. The service is available for anyone with a
	visual impairment who would benefit from having a regular visitor.</p>
<p>Visitors may:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Help with reading and answering mail, or sorting papers</li>
	<li>Help to choose large print or talking books.</li>
	<li>Go for a walk, shopping trip or on an outing with you.</li>
	<li>Help with leisure pursuits like swimming, gardening,
		crosswords, etc.</li>
	<li>Provide companionship and conversation over a cup of tea or
		coffee.</li>
	<li>Help with light practical tasks like changing light bulbs,
		batteries etc.</li>
	<li>Help with organising area of the home or aspects of your life
		in order to make them easier to manage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visitors are all volunteers who give their time freely. They are
	carefully selected and given some training, but essentially they are
	ordinary people, from all backgrounds and of all ages, who are willing
	to provide friendship to people who might otherwise be isolated. Most
	visitors visit regularly once a week or once a fortnight for a couple
	of hours, but some visitors can help with one-off tasks or short-term
	support.</p>
<p>What one client said:</p>
<blockquote>"I would be in a different place altogether if
	it wasn&lsquo;t for my volunteer"</blockquote>
<p>Visitors are not able to provide personal care.</p>
<p>If you would like to have a Volunteer Visitor, or know someone
	who might benefit from the service, please contact YBPSS</p>
