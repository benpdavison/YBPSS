<h3>Activities</h3>

<h4>Book Group</h4>
<p>On the first Tuesday of every month the book group meets to
	discuss a novel, biography or non-fiction book. We provide CDs or
	cassettes of the book the month before and we can try to meet requests
	for large print and Braille. We meet at 10.30am for coffee and a chat
	before the discussion. It is a very informal and friendly group.</p>
<h4>Walking Group</h4>
<p>This group undertakes walks in the local area on a Wednesday
	afternoon.</p>
<h4>Knit n Knatter Group</h4>
<p>This very popular group is a mixture of experienced knitters and
	those who had given up knitting because of deteriorating sight. It is a
	very friendly group, with volunteers on hand to help out and lots of
	new friends to "natter" with. Meets on Tuesdays, fortnightly at
	10.30am.</p>

	reminisce on topics suggested by the members. We have had lively
	discussions on such things as school days, health, food, holidays and
	Christmases past.</p>
<h4>Museums, Theatre Groups and other outings</h4>
