<h3>Supporting Activities</h3>

<p>The Society organises a lively programme of activities for our
	members, all of whom are visually impaired. Activities vary from a book
	group to a gentle exercise class, from a "knit and natter" group to
	learning opportunities like our recent series of talks on local
	history. There is a walking group and other outings are arranged to
	local places of interest and the theatre.</p>

<p>Volunteers provide considerable support for these groups, some
	meet and greet our members, others support the activity itself, while
	others may organise and serve refreshments. Outings often require
	additional people to act as escorts or sighted guides.</p>

<p>Most activities take place at, or start from, our offices in York
	on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings, but occasionally
	volunteers are required on other days and at other times for special
	events.</p>

<p>Some volunteers offer time on a regular basis with specific
	activities, while others agree to be called on when required. Vacancies
	for specific activities may vary, but we would be glad to hear from you
	if you would like to help support our activities.</p>

<p>You don&lsquo;t need any special skills to support activities â€“
	enthusiasm and commitment is all we need from you â€“ we will provide
	sighted guiding and Visual Impairment Awareness training.</p>

<p>Contact Ann Mattam, Activities Organiser ann.mattam@ybpss.org to
	find out how you could get involved.</p>
